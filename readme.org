* Introduction
This is a Super Mario clone or better said a platformer.

* Usage
Just play with the *cursor keys* and jump with *space*.

* Contributing
The project is licensed with the *MIT* licence and uses *npm*.

** Dependencies
To install the necessary *node* dependencies do:

~npm install~

** Cake commands
After installing the dependencies there are two *cake* commands made available:

~cake build~

~cake watch~

The first just builds the bundle _app.js_ file for each subproject while the second
matches for any changes in the _*.coffee_ files for each subproject and launches the
*build* step.
