#+TITLE: figshario

* Introduction
This is a Super Mario clone or better said a platformer.

* Usage
Just play with the *cursor keys* and jump with *space*.

* Contributing
The project is licensed with the *MIT* licence and uses *npm*.

** Dependencies
To install the necessary *node* dependencies do:

~npm install~

** Gulp commands
After installing the dependencies there are two *gulp* commands made available:

~gulp build
 gulp watch~

The first just builds the bundle _js/figshario.js_ file while the second
watches for any changes in the _*.js_ files from _src/_ and launches the
*build* step.

* Story
To keep track of what I want to implement and what I want to achieve, I have
created the [[file:./doc/story.org][story]] document.
