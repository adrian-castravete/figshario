* Introduction

*Welcome!*
I'm glad you stumbled upon this little place. This is *figshario*.

But first, what is it?  Well, it's a /Super Mario/ clone; a simple project that I made and hopefully will _enhance_ to be a full-featured *Javascript/HTML5* game engine.

** About this file

This file will be used to describe the story of the game, and keep a focus on the aim of the game in general. Think of it as a /story script/.

* Mechanics and Ideas

The idea is to /encompass/ the main beliefs and goals of figshare within the game and eventually set score points based on these ideas.  For example:
+ connect an action in the game with the real life action of sharing your work, or publishing good and bad data
+ points could thus be given for collected items that can be pieces of a paper or beakers and petri dishes

As such the following categories jump to mind:

** Collectibles

*** Papers, sheetsz

They can be sensible to gusts of wind, or just found on the floor.  Maybe they can be picked up by some enemies.

*** Beakers with liquids

The liquids may be collected and depending on their colors provide the user with some special powers or ammunition for some powers.

** Enemies

*** Suited man

Walks around, aimlessly, until in proximity of the hero or some collectibles.  In proximity of the player starts heading towards the player trying to hit him with the /embargo/ stamp.  In proximity of the *papers* they will steal it.  Upon _death_ drops any collected *papers*.

*** File cabinet

Moves around until reaching an obstacle.  Upon reaching an obstacle turns around.  Otherwise acts like the koopas from Super Mario.  Unlike them, or rather in addition, they can throw either shelves or files.  A maximum of three such items can be thrown.
