figshario
=========

This is a Super Mario clone or better said a platformer

Usage
-----

Just play with the **cursor keys** and jump with **space**.

Contributing
------------

The project is licensed with the **MIT** licence and uses **npm**.
To get started do::

  npm install

To install the necessary dependencies.

After that there are two **gulp** commands made available::

  gulp build
  gulp watch

The first just builds the bundle ``js/figshario.js`` file while the second
watches for any changes in the ``*.js`` files from ``src/`` and launches the
*build* step.
